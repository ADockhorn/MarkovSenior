# Setup

This section includes the necessary steps to get Markov Senior running on your system. Please be aware that the program has been developed on a Linux-based system and is optimized as such. The experience may be different on other distributions. Please raise a ticket via Github issues in case you face any problems.


## PIP

You will need Python 3 and the packages specified in requirements.txt.

We recommend setting up a virtual environment with pip and installing the packages there.

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you use the pip3 that belongs to your previously defined virtual environment.


# GUI

Running *Main.py* will start the GUI:

![MarkovSeniorMain](icons/MarkovSeniorMain.png)

The button on the left allows to load a level. Following the screen instructions you can set parameters to steer the learning process. Default parameters are set to learn a grammar able to replicate the level as accurate as possible.

![MarkovSeniorTrain](icons/MarkovSeniorTrain.png)

Results will be stored in the projects output folder. Going back to the main page or restarting the GUI allows you to run learned grammars and see their results.
